# FitForecast
GUI Project
Most pages have been converted from figma apart from one (hydration). We just need to add a bit more interactiveness, link them together then plug in the API calls.

Sunny and Night Page have a minor bug where it times out when calculating time of day after a couple of minutes, but should be fixed very soon.
I'll make the hydration information page and I am also planning to modiify the design of the clothing page to make it look cleaner and more interactive.
